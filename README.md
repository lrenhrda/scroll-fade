# ScrollFade

ScrollFade is an ES6 module that allows developers to add fade-in and fade-out behavior to elements on a page, in a fashion that is locked to the scroll position of the browser window. Locking it the scroll position helps to prevent the feeling of a loss of control when scrolling triggers animations that then play out at their own speed. Doing this hopefully results in a better, cleaner, more professional user experience.
